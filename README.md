# 🧠 Course & Independent Projects Showcase

This repository collects several of my **coursework and independent programming projects** completed recently.  
Each folder contains one of my selected **work samples**, focusing on algorithmic thinking, data structures, and systems implementation.

> ⚙️ Note: Most files here are **core logic excerpts** rather than full compilable projects.

## 📚 Overview

| Project | Language | Description |
|----------|-----------|-------------|
| [LinkedList](./LinkedList.cpp) | C++ | Implementation of a singly linked list supporting insertion, deletion, reversal, and rotation operations. |
| [NQueens Solver](./NQueens.cpp) | C++ | Non-recursive backtracking solver for N-Queens problem using manual stack operations. |

## 💻 About the Projects

### 🧩 LinkedList (C++)
Implements a singly linked list supporting insertion, deletion, reversal, duplication, and rotation of text nodes.  
Demonstrates understanding of dynamic memory allocation, pointer manipulation, and data structure design.

**Key Concepts:** Linked List Structure · Memory Management · Pointer Operations  
**File:** [`LinkedList.cpp`](./LinkedList.cpp)

---

### 👑 NQueens (C++)
Non-recursive solver using stack-based state tracking for backtracking.  
Shows understanding of iterative algorithms and combinatorial logic.

**Key Concepts:** Backtracking · Stack Simulation · State-Space Search  
**File:** [`NQueens.cpp`](./NQueens.cpp)
