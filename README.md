# 🧠 Course & Independent Projects Showcase

This repository collects several of my **coursework and independent programming projects** completed recently.  
Each folder contains one of my selected **work samples**, focusing on algorithmic thinking, data structures, and systems implementation.

> ⚙️ Note: Most files here are **core logic excerpts** rather than full compilable projects.
